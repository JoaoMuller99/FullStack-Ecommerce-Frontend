# WELCOME || BEM-VINDO

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

**Para ler esse README em portuguÃªs clique [aqui](https://github.com/JoaoMuller99/FullStack-Ecommerce-Frontend/blob/main/README_PT.md)!**

**For this project to work, you will need to clone and run [this](https://github.com/JoaoMuller99/FullStack-Ecommerce-Backend) code aswell!**

## Getting Started

First, install the packages by running:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

After that, you will have to configure the following ENVIROMENT VARIABLES at your **.env.local** file (create it in the root folder of this project):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API="http://localhost:1337/graphql"
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="YOUR STRIPE KEY"
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="YOUR STRIPE SECRET KEY"
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR AUTH0 CLIENT SECRET"
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID="YOUR AUTH0 CLIENT ID"
AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL="YOUR AUTH0 DOMAIN"
AUTH0_SECRET='use [openssl rand -hex 32] to generate a 32 bytes value'
AUTH0_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

## Setting Up Stripe

1. Create an account at [https://dashboard.stripe.com/login](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login).
2. Fill in your business profile (you can also skip it and fill it in later).
3. Create a business by clicking on _New Business_ and give it a name.
4. Copy your stripe publishable and secret keys and add it to your .env.local.

## Setting Up Auth0

1. Create an account at [https://auth0.com/](https://auth0.com/).
2. Create a new application.
3. Go to your application settings, copy and paste at your .env.local the needed keys (check the [docs](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs/interactive) for additional help).
4. Fill in the following fields.

```bash
Allowed Callback URLs: "http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback"
Allowed Logout URLs: "http://localhost:3000"
Allowed Web URLs: "http://localhost:3000"
```

## Finally

With the backend cofigured and running (click [here](https://github.com/JoaoMuller99/FullStack-Ecommerce-Backend) for more information), you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
